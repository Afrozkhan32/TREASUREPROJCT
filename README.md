# TREASUREPROJCT

The provided code is a simple text-based adventure game that guides the player through a series of choices in a treasure island scenario. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Art and Introduction: The game begins by printing an ASCII art banner, followed by a welcoming message that sets the scene for a treasure hunt.

First Choice (step_1): The player is prompted to choose a direction to move: "left" or "right" (input is taken as lowercase).

Left Path (if step_1 is 'left'):

The player then chooses between "swim" or "wait" (input for step_2).
If the player chooses "wait":
They face another decision on which door to enter: "red", "yellow", or "blue" (input for step_3).
Each door leads to a "game over" message, indicating that none of the options lead to success.
If the player chooses "swim", they receive a "game over" message.
Right Path (if step_1 is 'right'): This path directly leads to a "game over" message as well.

Overall, the game is structured with branching choices that ultimately all lead to the player losing (game over), suggesting that the game is designed to illustrate the mechanics of conditional statements in programming rather than to provide a fulfilling gameplay experience
